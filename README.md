# Rails Online Shop
The application features a separate interface for administrators and shoppers. Administrators are able to view and update current inventories using a sparse interface, while shoppers are able to browse items via a more image-based layout and add/remove items to a cart. 

This project required working in a pair for two days and then switching codebases with another pair. This repo is based on the code that I inherited and completed, but not that the code that I initially wrote.
